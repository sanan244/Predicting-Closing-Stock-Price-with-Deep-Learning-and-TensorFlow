Predicting-Closing Stock Price-with-Deep-Learning-and-TensorFlow

This project aims to predict the closing price of a stock for companies based on a continous daily stock history of many S&P 500 companies. Some attributes are excluded from training as they do not have significant correlation to the closing price target. The dataset was found on kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks/version/48).
